This is the Laravel package called "input" and serves as an extract-map-load configuration (EML) as part of the datatank core application (tdt/core). The current instances of the eml stack are focussed on semantifying data. This means that raw data can be transformed into semantic data by providing a mapping file. This package works with PHP 5.4 or more.
